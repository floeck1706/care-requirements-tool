How to startup:
* start baseX -> basex>bin\basexhttp (context of basex not \bin works for some
  reason better -FE) ????
* localhoast port is shown (should be 8984)
* start chrome (issues on firefox to store reqs) localhost:port/care-webapp (localhost:8984/care-webapp)
* basex>bin\basexgui opens IDE
